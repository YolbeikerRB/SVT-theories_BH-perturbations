# Odd-parity perturbations in the most general scalar-vector-tensor theory

In this Mathematica notebook, I presented the Lagrangian coefficients derived through perturbations in the most general scalar-vector-tensor theory.
These coefficients pave the way for an in-depth exploration of the stability of static spherically symmetric black holes when subjected to linear odd-parity perturbations. 

This mathematical notebook serves as a valuable supplement to the research paper: [Ref.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6382/acc50d#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20the,master%20equation%20for%20these%20perturbations.)
